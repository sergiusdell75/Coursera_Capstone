# Smart relocation

A relocation is stressful. Ideally, a new hire should be able to fully concentrate on the job requirements without spending lots of time to settle in. A real-estate agency is often approached to find a temporary accommodation for new employees.  Depending on the preferences (profile) of the new hire, the estate agent usually provides the best matches based on the experience (classical approach). However the experience only reflects the past without a projection into the future.

A modern approach based on the data analytics enables to allocate the best possible place for the temporary accommodation based on the following categories: venues,  rental (monthly) costs, crimes, schools (only applies if the new hire has got children). Moreover, the historical data can be used to make some predictions on the neighborhood of the current accommodation,e.g.  w.r.t. crime, to exclude or put a more weight on this particular  neighborhood for the future clients.

The business need: optimize the rent of the temporary accommodation. Better matches imply fully satisfied clients and a quicker turn around. First create a profile of the client based on his current neighborhood. Then search for a best-fit place for the temporary accommodation. Moreover, predictions about  the  neighborhood could save time in decision making, which implies  a better performance.

In this project, I used Berlin as a place to move in.
